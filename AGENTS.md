# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Agent skills

### Applying skills

For substantive work (planning, implementing, reviewing, debugging, writing a PR, editing agent docs), load the skills in `.agents/skills/` whose description directly matches the task, and follow them as written. Load each skill once per session and reuse it from context after that. Trivial tasks (a typo, a one-line fix, a question answered from context) run without skills. End each substantive report with `Skills: <names>` or `Skills: none`.

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues (`Rdha904/techstyles`), via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary: needs-triage, needs-info, ready-for-agent, ready-for-human, wontfix. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `GLOSSARY.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
